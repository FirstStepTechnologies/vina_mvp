##  The Problem: Why Resolutions Fail
Every January, millions commit to "upskilling" or "learning AI". By February, 80% have quit. Why?
- **Generic Content:** A Project Manager in Construction doesn't care about AI for coding.
- **Passive Consumption:** Watching long videos doesn't create retention.
- **Lack of Feedback:** No one tells you if you're actually getting it.

## 💡 The Solution: Vina
Vina is an **Adaptive, Agentic Learning Platform** that turns generic goals into hyper-personalized, bite-sized video lessons. It doesn't just teach "AI"—it teaches "AI for *Your* Job".

### Key Features
- ** Hyper-Personalized Curriculum**: Generates lessons tailored specifically to your **Profession**, **Industry**, and **Experience Level**.
- ** Dynamic Video Lessons**: Creates engaging, short-form (TikTok-style) vertical videos on the fly using **ElevenLabs** and **Imagen 3**, explaining complex concepts with relevant analogies.
- ** Active Recall & Adaptation**: Interactive quizzes test your knowledge. If you struggle, Vina simplifies the next lesson. If you excel, it accelerates.
- ** Agentic Evaluation**: Every lesson is critiqued and improved by a "Reviewer Agent" before you ever see it, ensuring high pedagogical quality.
